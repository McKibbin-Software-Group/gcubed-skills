# Project Memory

Create or refresh a repository's lightweight memory layer without polluting default context.

This skill owns project documentation memory. It does not own global `AGENTS.md` setup or Architect methodology setup. Use `$setup-gcubed-skills` for those setup tasks.

## Baseline Shape

Expected memory set:

- `AGENTS.md`: concise repo-local guardrails only; no runtime flow, status history, release process, environment catalog, or architecture overview.
- `docs/00-START-HERE.md`: entrypoint and source-of-truth map.
- `docs/01-repo-overview.md`: stable project map, architecture, key directories, commands.
- `docs/02-current-status.md`: current behavior, recent changes, risks, validation.
- `docs/03-roadmap.md`: milestones, priorities, deferred work, sequencing.
- `docs/04-next-steps.md`: practical pickup list.
- `docs/adr/`: hint directory; add ADRs only for durable choices with tradeoffs.
- `docs/ai/`: hint directory; add temporary handoff, investigation, or plan files only when useful.

Copy and adapt templates from `assets/templates/` when creating missing files. Treat them as starting points, not boilerplate to leave untouched.

Keep `assets/snippets/project-memory-methodology.md` short; the full baseline and authoring rules live here.

## Progressive Disclosure

- Keep generated `AGENTS.md` and the methodology snippet lean: point to memory, do not embed the whole system.
- Keep baseline, setup mechanics, and refresh rules here, loaded only when `$project-memory` runs.
- Use `docs/00-START-HERE.md` as the map, then open only docs needed for the task.
- Link instead of duplicating architecture, runtime flow, commands, release process, or status.

## Setup or Refresh Workflow

Use this for missing memory or stale, incomplete, placeholder-heavy docs.

1. Read any existing root `AGENTS.md`, `docs/00-START-HERE.md`, baseline docs, and nearby domain/architecture docs before writing.
2. Inspect repo shape with `rg --files`, manifests, deployment/config files, tests, scripts, recent work, validation signals, and user context.
3. Preserve useful existing doc structure and voice. Avoid broad rewrites when targeted updates will do.
4. Keep each doc short and link to deeper docs instead of duplicating detail.
5. Put durable project truth in `docs/`; put temporary investigation notes and draft plans in `docs/ai/`.
6. Never overwrite existing docs unread. Explain substantial structural moves first.

For setup:

- Create only the missing baseline files and hint directories.
- Preserve existing doc style and naming when useful.
- Copy templates from `assets/templates/`, replace placeholders with discovered repo facts, and delete sections that do not apply.

For refresh:

- Do not treat existing files as a no-op by default.
- Distinguish stale from still-accurate content before changing it.
- Replace stale facts and placeholders with discovered facts.
- If information cannot be discovered, write a dated unknown such as "Not identified from repo scan on YYYY-MM-DD" only when keeping the section is still useful.
- Update `docs/02-current-status.md` and `docs/04-next-steps.md` first after substantial work; update overview, roadmap, ADRs, or `docs/ai/` only when facts changed.
- Summarize semantic changes, validation run or skipped, and remaining unknowns before writing.

If noticed during unrelated work, do not derail the task; briefly offer to run setup later.

## AGENTS.md Boundary

`AGENTS.md` is part of the baseline, but it is instruction prose rather than ordinary documentation.

- If root `AGENTS.md` is missing during project-memory setup, propose a concise repo-local file from `assets/templates/AGENTS.md` and render `{{PROJECT_MEMORY_METHODOLOGY}}` from `assets/snippets/project-memory-methodology.md`.
- If root `AGENTS.md` exists and mixes agent guardrails with durable project facts, treat that as documentation drift. Propose moving durable facts into the smallest appropriate `docs/` file and rewriting `AGENTS.md` as lean guardrails.
- Keep guardrails short and actionable: usually 5-10 bullets, one or two lines each. If a guardrail needs background, examples, runtime flow, or operational procedure, put the explanation in `docs/` and link or point to it from `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep only constraints that should shape agent behavior before or while reading project docs: safety rules, approval boundaries, validation expectations, repository-specific hazards, and pointers into the docs memory set.
- Do not preserve runtime flow, environment variable catalogs, release procedure, architecture overview, current status, roadmap, or long maintenance notes in `AGENTS.md` merely because they already exist there.
- Architect methodology adoption still belongs to `$setup-gcubed-skills`; use that skill when the user wants to install or refresh MSG-owned methodology blocks.
- When adding project-memory guidance, use `assets/snippets/project-memory-methodology.md` between its BEGIN/END markers.
- Show a semantic summary and diff/full file before writing any `AGENTS.md` change, and write only after explicit approval.

## Update Workflow

After substantial work, update the smallest relevant docs:

- Update `docs/02-current-status.md` when behavior, deployment state, known risks, or validation state changes.
- Update `docs/04-next-steps.md` when the next operator/agent action changes.
- Update `docs/01-repo-overview.md` when architecture, directory ownership, or core workflows change.
- Update `docs/03-roadmap.md` when priority or sequencing changes.
- Add an ADR only for durable decisions with meaningful tradeoffs.
- Promote lasting findings from `docs/ai/` into canonical docs; prune or mark temporary notes as superseded.

Do not paste chat transcripts. Summarize outcomes, decisions, commands, and verification signals in current-state language. Use concrete dates when recording status.

## Writing Rules

- Optimize for fast pickup by a future human or agent.
- Prefer bullets, links, and short sections over narrative.
- Record "what is true now" and "what to do next"; avoid historical archaeology unless it explains current constraints.
- Keep secrets, token paths, and sensitive environment dumps out of docs.
- Make validation explicit: command run, result, date, and any gaps.
- When uncertain, mark assumptions and open questions plainly.

## Template Use

Templates live at:

- `assets/templates/AGENTS.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/00-START-HERE.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/01-repo-overview.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/02-current-status.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/03-roadmap.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/04-next-steps.md`
- `assets/templates/docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` when a handoff note is useful
- `assets/templates/docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` when an ADR is useful
- `assets/snippets/project-memory-methodology.md`

When using templates, replace placeholders with repo-specific facts discovered from files and render snippet placeholders from their canonical snippet files. Delete sections that do not apply. Before proposing generated docs, check the proposed `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` content for unresolved `TODO` placeholders and either resolve them, remove the section, or mark a dated unknown.
